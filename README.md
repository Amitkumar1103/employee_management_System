### üöÄ Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amitkumar1103/employee_management_System.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd employee_management_System
    ```
3.  **Set up the database**:
      * Create a new database in MySQL. The code references a database named `ems_db`.
      * The `DBConnection.java` class contains the database connection details. You may need to update the `URL`, `USER`, and `PASSWORD` to match your local MySQL configuration.
      * The application will create the `employees` table automatically on the first run.
4.  **Add the MySQL Connector JAR file**:
      * Place the downloaded `mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar` file in the `lib` directory of your project.
      * Make sure this JAR is included in your project's build path in your IDE (e.g., in VS Code, you can do this by dragging the file to the `lib` folder in the file explorer and adding it to the classpath).
5.  **Run the application**:
      * Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
      * The application will display a menu of options, and you can interact with it through the terminal.
